				<p>This is a virtual synth I put together using HTML/CSS/JS for my Personal Learning Experience in my junior year Theory of Knowledge class. My objective was to learn how to  do something with JavaScript and a synth seemed to adequately combine my interest in music and programming.</p>

			<div class="description">
				<p>IA stands for Internal Assessment, which is a large project required by IB. For my CS IA in senior year, I made a website containing simulations of circular motion concepts using JS canvas. As well as programming, the project included design processes and, of course, documentation. Everyone's favorite part of programming.</p>

				<p>In my sophomore year, my Game Programming class was tasked with a semester long project in which we had to create a game using Unity and ourown assets. In my game, the player navigates a treacherous river as a bear trying to return to their family, all the while shooting fish with a back-mounted turret.</p>

			<div class="description">
				<p>This game project was similar to my sophomore year; the differences were that I was a freshman and my class used Game Maker. The player tries to survive all 8 of my freshman-year classes by avoiding enemies, navigating mazes, and math.</p>
